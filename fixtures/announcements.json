It is one of a series of planetary nebulae that were named after their discoverer, Czech astronomer Lubo&scaron; Kohoutek. A planetary nebula is formed from material in the outer layers of a red giant star that were expelled into interstellar space when the star was in the late stages of its life. Ultraviolet radiation emitted from the remaining hot core of the star ionises the ejected gas shells, causing them to glow.</p><p>In the specific case of K 4-55, a bright inner ring is surrounded an asymmetric, fainter layer. The entire system is then surrounded by a faint red halo of light emitted by ionised nitrogen. This multi-shell structure is fairly uncommon in planetary nebulae.</p><p>This Hubble image was taken on 4 May 2009, with WFPC2. The colours represent the makeup of the various emission regions in the nebula: red represents nitrogen, green indicates hydrogen and blue, oxygen. K 4-55 is nearly 4600 light-years away in the constellation of Cygnus.</p><p>The WFPC2 instrument, which was installed in 1993 to replace the Wide Field/Planetary Camera, will be removed to make room for the Wide Field Camera 3 during the upcoming Hubble Servicing Mission.</p><p>During the camera's 16-year tour of duty, WFPC2 has provided outstanding science and spectacular images of the cosmos, an enduring legacy of astronomical treasures.

The image of the winner, a group of interacting galaxies called Arp 274, was revealed during ESO's \"Around the World in 80 Telescopes\" webcast. The striking object received 67,021 votes out of the nearly 140,000 votes cast for the six candidate targets.</p><p>On 1-2 April Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 captured Arp 274 (also known as NGC 5679). Arp 274 is a system of three galaxies that appear to be partially overlapping in the image, although they may be at somewhat different distances. The spiral shapes of two of these galaxies appear mostly intact. The third galaxy (far left) is more compact, but shows evidence of star formation.</p><p>Two of the three galaxies are forming new stars at a high rate. This is evident in the bright blue knots of star formation that are strung along the arms of the galaxy on the right and along the small galaxy on the left.</p><p>The largest component is located in the middle of the three. It appears as a spiral galaxy, which may be barred. The entire system resides at about 400 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo.</p><p>Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 was used to image Arp 274. Blue, yellow and infrared filters were combined with a filter that isolates hydrogen emission. The colours in this image reflect the intrinsic colour of the different stellar populations that make up the galaxies. Yellowish older stars can be seen in the central bulge of each galaxy. A bright central cluster of stars pinpoint each nucleus. Younger blue stars trace the spiral arms, along with pinkish nebulae that are illuminated by new star formation. Interstellar dust is silhouetted against the starry population. The pair of foreground stars on the right are inside our own Milky Way.</p><p>The International Year of Astronomy 2009 is the celebration of the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first observations with a telescope.

The problem arose when a low voltage power supply failed to reach the minimum voltage prior to a system check. Due to changes in the configuration of ACS in anticipation of the planned servicing mission and a reset of the system clock, there was insufficient time allowed between the power-up and the health check.  Timing analysis confirmed that the minimum 8 volts was attained by the LVPS shortly after the check.  Accordingly, the software has been changed for all future ACS operations. The ACS solar blind channel should be operational by the middle of next week.</p><p>The second anomaly caused the reset of both the Control Unit/Science Data Formatter-B and the NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer-1 (NSSC-1) Central Processing Module-B (CPM-B). Analysis of the event revealed that both events occurred instantaneously and simultaneously. This was the key to solving the problem: it was almost certainly a momentary short or open circuit that has since closed. Had the Data Formatter restarted on its own there would be a delay of about one second before a NSSC-1 restart. Such events are not uncommon when re-powering dormant systems - especially if they have been offline for 18 years. The CUSDF has been active since the reboot last week without any problems. Activities on 23 October 2008 saw the restoration of the NSSC-1 computer.</p><p>Assuming no problems arise, the schedule is to bring the WFPC-2 instrument back online sometime around noon CEST on the 25 October. The ACS instrument will follow and then NICMOS. The restoration of NICMOS is more complicated. Firstly, the instrument will brought out of safe mode and the electronics on the cooling circuits activated before bringing the instrument down to operating temperatures.</p><p>The replacement component  scheduled for deployment on Servicing Mission 4 is still undergoing evaluation and testing. By mid-November, engineers should reach a point where they can determine the viability of a February launch for the servicing mission. It is likely that the activity to replace the component would take place during EVA-1.</p><p>Throughout all the testing and checks on the science instruments the main Hubble computer has performed as expected. The main functions of the spacecraft are unaffected by the recent problems and it continues to carry out astrometric observations via the fine guidance sensors.</p><p><b>Image credit</b>: NASA/ESA</p>", "links": "<a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/news/status_rpt_6_20081023.html\">NASA's update</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.webb.org/about/general/instruments/index.html\">About Hubble instruments</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.webb.org/about/history/servicing_mission_4.html\">About Hubble Servicing Mission 4</a><br />", "contacts": "<p>Lars Lindberg Christensen<br />Hubble/ESA, Garching, Germany<br />Tel: +49-89-3200-6306<br />Cellular: +49-173-3872-621<br />E-mail: lars@eso.org</p>", "release_date": "2008-10-24 01:30:00", "title": "Green light for Hubble operations", "created": "2010-04-22 13:52:42", "last_modified": "2010-04-22 13:52:42", "published": 1}}, {"pk": "ann0818", "model": "announcements.announcement", "fields": {"embargo_date": "2008-10-18 10:00:00", "description": "<p>Engineers at NASA continue to investigate the two anomalies which occurred during the reactivation of the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope last week.

The object was first detected on 21 February 2006 while scientists were using Hubble to survey very distant galaxy clusters for supernovae. The object continued to brighten by a factor of over 100 during the course of the next three months, without exceeding magnitude 21, and then faded away in an identical manner.

Actually this image, taken by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, is a very thin section of a supernova remnant caused by a stellar explosion that occurred more than 1,000 years ago.</p><p>On or around 1 May 1006 A.D., observers from Africa to Europe to the Far East witnessed and recorded the arrival of light from what is now called SN 1006, a tremendous supernova explosion caused by the final death throes of a white dwarf star nearly 7,000 light-years away. The supernova was probably the brightest star ever seen by humans, and surpassed Venus as the brightest object in the night time sky, only to be surpassed by the Moon. It was visible even during the day for weeks, and remained visible to the naked eye for at least two and a half years before fading away.</p><p>SN 1006 resides within our Milky Way Galaxy. Located more than 14 degrees off the plane of the galaxy's disk, there is relatively little confusion with other foreground and background objects in the field when trying to study this object. In the Hubble image, many background galaxies (orange extended objects) far off in the distant universe can be seen dotting the image. Most of the white dots are foreground or background stars in our Milky Way galaxy.</p><p>This image is a composite of hydrogen-light observations taken with Hubble's Advanced  Camera for Surveys in February 2006 and Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations in blue, yellow-green, and near-infrared light taken in April 2008.

Ultraviolet light from the remnant star makes the material glow. Planetary nebulae last for only 10,000 years, a fleeting episode in the 10-billion-year lifespan of Sun-like stars.</p><p>The name planetary nebula has nothing to do with planets. They got their name because their round shapes resembled planets when seen through the small telescopes of the eighteenth century.</p><p>The Hubble images show the evolution of planetary nebulae, revealing how they expand in size and change temperature over time. A young planetary nebula, such as He 2-47, at top, left, for example, is small and is dominated by relatively cool, glowing nitrogen gas. In the Hubble images, the red, green, and blue colours represent light emitted by nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, respectively.</p><p>Over thousands of years, the clouds of gas expand away and the nebulae become larger. Energetic ultraviolet light from the star penetrates more deeply into the gas, causing the hydrogen and oxygen to glow more prominently, as seen near the center of NGC 5315. In the older nebulae, such as IC 4593, at bottom, left, and NGC 5307, at bottom, right, hydrogen and oxygen appear more extended in these regions, and red knots of nitrogen are still visible.</p><p>These four nebulae all lie in our Milky Way Galaxy. Their distances from Earth are all roughly the same, about 7,000 light-years. The snapshots were taken with Hubble?s Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in February 2007. Like snowflakes, planetary nebulae show a wide variety of shapes, indicative of the complex processes that occur at the end of stellar life.</p><p>He 2-47, at top, left, is dubbed the ?starfish? because of its shape. The six lobes of gas and dust, which resemble the legs of a starfish, suggest that He 2-47 puffed off material at least three times in three different directions. Each time, the star fired off a narrow pair of opposite jets of gas. He 2-47 is in the southern constellation Carina.</p><p>NGC 5315, the chaotic-looking nebula at top, right, reveals an x-shaped structure. This shape suggests that the star ejected material in two different outbursts in two distinct directions. Each outburst unleashed a pair of diametrically opposed outflows. NGC 5315 lies in the southern constellation Circinus.</p><p> IC 4593, at bottom, left, is in the northern constellation Hercules.</p><p>NGC 5307, at bottom, right, displays a spiral pattern, which may have been caused by the dying star wobbling as it expelled jets of gas in different directions. NGC 5307 resides in the southern constellation Centaurus.</p>", "links": "<a href=\"http://www.webb.org/bin/images.pl?searchtype=freesearch&string;=opo0733\">More images</a><br /><a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/news/2007/33\">NASA?s release</a><br />", "contacts": "<p>Lars Lindberg Christensen<br />Hubble/ESA, Garching, Germany<br />Tel: +49-89-3200-6306<br />Cellular: +49-173-3872-621<br />E-mail: lars@eso.org</p>", "release_date": "2007-09-11 15:00:00", "title": "Hubble Captures Stars Going Out in Style", "created": "2010-04-22 13:52:44", "last_modified": "2010-04-22 13:52:44", "published": 1}}, {"pk": "ann0709", "model": "announcements.announcement", "fields": {"embargo_date": null, "description": "<p>The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope captures a rare view of the entire ring system of the planet Uranus, tilted edge-on to Earth.</p><p>The rings were photographed with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on August 14, 2007.</p><p>The edge-on rings appear as spikes above and below the planet.

This standard is part of the Astronomy Visualization Metadata (AVM) standard that will facilitate access to \"print-ready\" astronomical images saved in general formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and PNG that have been mainly obtained from astronomical observations.</b></p><p>Compelling imagery is a key tool of the astronomical education and public outreach (EPO) community to convey science results to the general public. These images are both derived from scientific observations and created as artistic visualizations of scientific results. They are typically available in common JPEG, TIFF, and PNG formats, not in the original scientific data formats (e.g. FITS files). Such resources are currently scattered across the internet in a variety of galleries and archives, but are not searchable in any coherent way that will isolate astronomy themed images in their appropriate context.</p><p>Just as Virtual Observatory standards open up all data archives to a common query engine, the EPO community will benefit greatly from a similar mechanism for image search and retrieval. A new standard, called the Astronomy Visualization Metadata (AVM) standard, has been developed for astronomical imagery defining a common set of content metadata fields suited for the needs of astronomical images. This encompasses images derived from data, artist's conceptions, simulations, photography, and can be ultimately extensible to video products. The first generation of tools are now available to tag images with this metadata, which can be embedded with the image file using an XML-based format that functions similarly to a FITS header.</p><p>As image collections are processed to include these AVM tags, extensive information providing educational context, credits, data sources, and even coordinate information will be readily accessible for uses spanning casual browsing, publication, and interactive media systems. The standard will &ndash; with time ?&ndash; allow individual image files to be catalogued and offered through search engines such as Google, the Virtual Observatory (VO) and other visualization tools. As the embedded metadata is of especial importance in digital photography and the publication industry, the standard for AVM proves to be a helpful tool since it smoothly integrates into those workflows. The new standard is similar to, and compatible with, the IPTC standard that is much used by digital photographers.</p><p>While the initial intent is to provide a wide variety of the astronomical outreach community with astronomical images, an extension is under way to also include metadata for videos as well.</p><p>The AVM standard has been endorsed by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) and was written by Robert Hurt (Spitzer Science Center), Lars Lindberg Christensen (ESA/Hubble), Adrienne Gauthier (Steward Observatory) with input from the IAU Virtual Repository Working Group under IAU Commission 55 Communicating Astronomy with the Public.</p>", "links": "<a href=\"http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/latest/AOIMetadata.html\">The full description of the AVM metadata</a><br />", "contacts": "<p>Lars Lindberg Christensen<br />Hubble/ESA, Garching, Germany<br />Tel: +49-89-3200-6306<br />Cellular: +49-173-3872-621<br />E-mail: lars@eso.org</p><p>Robert L.

These observations of the earliest stages in the evolution of galaxies provide new evidence for the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation &ndash; the idea that large galaxies built up over time as smaller galaxies collided and merged. An international team of astronomers used the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to explore the formation of galaxies during the first 900 million years after the Big Bang. They reported their latest findings in the September 14 issue of the journal Nature. Deep observations in three dark patches of sky &ndash; the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey fields &ndash; gathered the faint light emitted 13 billion years ago by stars in primeval galaxies. Only the brightest galaxies could be detected at such great distances. The researchers observed hundreds of bright galaxies at around 900 million years after the Big Bang. But when they looked deeper, about 200 million years earlier in time, they only found one. Relaxing their search criteria a bit turned up a few more candidates, so there must have been a lot of merging of smaller galaxies during those 200 million years.</p><p>This panel shows four candidate galaxies that are likely to have redshifts of 7 and thus have emitted their light when the Universe was just 750 million years old. Astronomers can determine when light was emitted from a distant source by its redshift, a measure of how the expansion of the Universe stretched the wavelengths of the light as it traveled through space across vast distances.</p><p>Each of the four candidate high-redshift galaxies are presented in a distinct row. All four candidate galaxies are shown using images at each of five different wavelengths (591 nm, 776 nm, 944 nm, 1119 nm, and 1604 nm). These galaxies are all clearly detected at wavelengths redder than 1000 nm (indicated by the z, J and H filters), but remain completely undetected at wavelengths bluer than 800 nm (indicated by the V and i filters). This abrupt drop-off in the flux is strongly characteristic of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts and occurs due to the absorption of light by the large amounts of neutral hydrogen in the Universe at early times. Astronomers use the presence of this break to find high-redshift galaxies. The search is described in the September 14, 2006 issue of Nature.</p>", "links": "<a href=\"http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=939\">University of California, Santa Cruz</a><br /><a href=\"http://firstgalaxies.ucolick.org/\">Scientist's web page</a><br />", "contacts": "", "release_date": "2006-09-14 09:00:00", "title": "Tracing the evolution of the first galaxies in the Universe", "created": "2010-04-22 13:52:45", "last_modified": "2010-04-22 13:52:45", "published": 1}}, {"pk": "ann0601", "model": "announcements.announcement", "fields": {"embargo_date": null, "description": "<p>ESA/Hubble has released the first comprehensive free digital archive with fulldome movies in the world.
