Mapping the formation of these ancient superclusters is a critical step in understanding the dark matter and dark energy that shape these structures. Read an excerpt about this research from Subaru Telescope\u02bbs science highlight below.\u00a0</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>A team of astronomers used the Subaru Telescope and Gemini North telescope to reveal that a well-known distant supercluster is part of a larger structure at least twice as extended as what was already known. The galaxies associated with the supercluster are thought to have formed simultaneously over a vast area and then evolved to their observed states.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) Gemini North telescope and the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph (FOCAS) on Subaru Telescope, the team has revealed that the supercluster CL1604, a distant supercluster located about 7.3 billion light-years away, is a large-scale 3-D structure extending over about 160 million light-years in the north-south direction. This is more than two times more extended than what was already known. Until now, we saw merely the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of the supercluster. The wide-field capability of the Subaru Telescope enabled us to survey the whole of the supercluster and the Gemini North telescope played a critical role in confirming the structures. This is the outcome of the good synergy of the telescopes of the Maunakea observatories.</p>\r\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 71.2848%; height: 51px;\" border=\"1\" bgcolor=\"00aeef\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.gemini.edu/node/21253\">Read the original release on the Gemini Observatory website</a></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Read the full science highlight from Subaru Telescope <a href=\"https://subarutelescope.org/en/results/2019/10/22/2805.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>These results were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pasj/psz097\">published</a> in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan (Hayashi et al., \u201cThe whole picture of the large-scale structure of the CL1604 supercluster at z\u223c0.9\u201d).

    "description": "<p>In early November, the GEMMA (<a href=\"https://www.gemini.edu/gemma/index.html\">Gemini in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy</a>) project brought together science communications professionals to explore the unique opportunities and challenges of communicating Multi-Messenger and Time-Domain Astronomy, two rapidly growing fields in astronomy. Funded by the US <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/\">National Science Foundation</a>, this communications summit hosted more than 30 participants for two days at the Space Telescope Science Institute (<a href=\"http://www.stsci.edu/\">STScI</a>) in Baltimore, Maryland, an AURA-managed facility.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Until the mid-20th century, our view of the Universe was limited almost entirely to the narrow band of light that could penetrate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and was visible either to our eyes or to sensitive photographic plates loaded at the focus of increasingly large telescopes. The first major expansion of our view came with the development of radio astronomy, leading to the realization that the Universe could look very different when seen through different \u201ceyes\u201d tuned to a different type of radiation. Since then astronomers have studied the Universe at all wavelengths, and this more complete \u201cmultiwavelength\u201d view of the Universe produced a wondrous and often breathtakingly beautiful picture of a Universe whose richness could not have been imagined.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>However, over the past decade or so, discoveries have been made with \u201cmessengers\u201d from space that go beyond photons, the messenger of light: particles from distant galaxies, neutrinos from the Sun and supernovae, and most recently ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself, known as gravitational waves. Multi-Messenger Astronomy is now the term we use when astronomers detect the same object or event with either light and particles, light and gravitational waves, particles and gravitational waves, or all three together (which has yet to occur). As the science in each of these three areas advances, these multi-messenger events will reveal an even more complete picture of the Universe and we will learn more about our cosmic history than any one of these individual types of signal, or messengers, can provide in isolation.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, a growing realization of the Universe\u2019s dynamic nature has crept into astronomy. Things that \u201cgo bump in the night\u201d are not new: comets, shooting stars and planets have been observed and discussed for millennia. However, by and large, our Universe has on larger scales seemed static and only evolving over cosmological timescales. Over the past decades, it has turned out that there is a lot more action than we thought, and sometimes on short timescales like days, hours, seconds or even less. Supernovae explode, stars change in brightness, novae flare, and outbursts occur in regions around black holes. Early in the 2020s, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (<a href=\"https://nationalastro.org/programs/vera-c-rubin-observatory/\">LSST</a>), funded mainly by the NSF and DOE, will begin a ten-year mission to produce a deep, wide, multi-band photometric map of approximately half the sky. The LSST is expected to yield 10 million transient \u201calerts\u201d for such changing phenomena each clear night, ushering in a golden age for Time-Domain Astronomy.</p>\r\n<p>The traditional way of doing astronomy \u2014\u00a0 where individual astronomers travel to a telescope, take a spectrum of a galaxy and then go home and analyze it \u2014 will remain an option, but chances are that the big discoveries will be made by big-science infrastructures in big collaborations, and possibly increasingly in new areas like Multi-Messenger and Time-Domain Astronomy. As ordinary matter only accounts for up to 5% of the Universe, the remaining 95% is largely undiscovered. Who knows what kind of new physics will come out of these two up-and-coming areas of astronomy, and this involves tremendous opportunities, but also challenges, for science communicators. At the same time, it is also clear that the communication needs of our society and its citizens have changed.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Participants in the GEMMA summit engaged in wide-ranging discussions, from the establishment of libraries of shared communication resources and protocols for press releases and media communications, to the possibility of a professional network for those involved in the communication of Multi-Messenger and Time-Domain Astronomy. Participants also shared their expertise with in-depth presentations on topics such as: the scientific future of Multi-Messenger and Time-Domain Astronomy; what to anticipate once the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is operational; the challenges of traditional print media; science communication via social and new media; and many of the lessons learned from past communications on Multi-Messenger and Time-Domain Astronomy discoveries.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The GEMMA team and staff of the NSF extend a special thanks to STScI for their critical help with logistics and facility coordination. The GEMMA program is funded by an award from the National Science Foundation to advance the leadership role of Gemini Observatory in the era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy. The program is designed to maximize synergies with the transformative facilities coming online in the near future. The projects within GEMMA specifically focus on the areas of high spatial resolution, rapid-response astronomy and communications. Gemini is part of NSF\u2019s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory which has recently launched.\u00a0</p>",

    "headline": "New data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have provided the strongest evidence yet for mid-sized black holes in the Universe. Hubble confirms that this “intermediate-mass” black hole dwells inside a dense star cluster.",
    "description": "<p>The announcement was made jointly by Ralph Gaume, Director of the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences, Kathy Turner, DOE (Department of Energy) program manager of the Office of High Energy Physics and LSST Director Steve Kahn.<em>\u00a0\u201cNamed after an astronomer who provided important evidence of the existence of dark matter, the NSF Vera C. Rubin Observatory is set to make science history with its extraordinary capabilities that will come to bear in the next few years,\u201d</em>\u00a0said France C\u00f3rdova, director of NSF.\u00a0<em>\u201cCongress has helped make this inspiring commemoration a reality. The Rubin Observatory is expected to significantly advance what we know about dark matter and dark energy, so the Rubin name will have yet another way to inspire women and men eager to investigate.\u201d</em></p>\r\n<p>Vera Rubin\u2019s career spanned several areas in observational astronomy but she is most recognized for uncovering the discrepancy between the observed and predicted motions of matter in galaxies. This discrepancy is interpreted as evidence for dark matter, which exerts gravitational force but does not emit light as ordinary matter does. Her work was confirmed using numerous observational techniques and it has had a major impact on cosmology.</p>\r\n<p><em>\u201cWe are pleased that LSST has now been named the Vera C. Rubin Observatory,\u201d</em>\u00a0said Rubin\u2019s sons Allan Rubin, David Rubin, and Karl Rubin.\u00a0<em>\u201cWe believe that this is a great way to honor our mother\u2019s achievements in astronomy and her work for equal rights for women in science.\u201d</em></p>\r\n<p>The initiative to name the observatory in honor of Rubin began in June 2019 when House Science Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n proposed the idea. It was enacted into law on 20 December 2019 and represents the first national observatory named in honor of a woman. It is fitting that Rubin\u2019s name is attached to an observatory in Chile, where women\u2019s participation in astronomy has been comparatively strong.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>The Rubin Observatory features facilities currently under construction in Chile which will be completed in 2022. It consists of an integrated system featuring a wide-field ground-based telescope with an 8.4-meter mirror. During 10 years of operation starting in 2022, the Rubin Observatory together with the 3,200 megapixel DOE LSST Camera and the data facility will carry out an unprecedented optical survey of the visible sky named the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The design of the LSST survey is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. The science operations to deliver the LSST survey will be jointly funded by NSF and DOE.</p>\r\n<p>The telescope at the Rubin Observatory is now named the Simonyi Survey Telescope in recognition of a significant private donation made early in the construction phase that was used to design, develop, and fabricate the telescope\u2019s primary mirror.</p>\r\n<p><em>\u201cIt is exciting that this wonderful observing system will be named after Vera Rubin. Dr. Rubin was a strong advocate of public facilities for science as a means of ensuring the best ideas got to see the light of day (or night). Much of her astronomy research was accomplished on NSF-funded, national facilities open to all astronomers, so having her name on this new NSF facility is appropriate and a great way to honor her work and impact on our field,\u201d\u00a0</em>said Robert Blum, Acting Director of Operations at the Rubin Observatory.</p>\r\n<p>For more details, see the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.lsst.org/news/vro-press-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">press release</a>\u00a0issued by the Rubin Observatory.</p>",

Astronomers now suggest that a full-grown planet never existed in the first place.

    "description": "<p>Perched atop Tohono O\u2019odham Nation land in the Arizona-Sonoran Desert, exoplanet-hunting spectrograph NEID [1] is now on the road to discovering Earth-mass exoplanets. The new instrument, an extreme precision radial velocity spectrometer, is collecting starlight on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory (<a href=\"https://nationalastro.org/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/\">KPNO</a>), a program of the NSF\u2019s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (<a href=\"https://nationalastro.org/\">NSF\u2019s OIR Lab</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The announcement of first light was made at a press conference held today at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.</p>\r\n<p>NEID detects exoplanets by measuring the subtle effect these planets have on their parent stars. Planets tug gravitationally on the star they orbit, producing a small \u201cwobble\u201d \u2014 a periodic shift in the velocity of the star. This happens in our own Solar System \u2014 Jupiter causes the Sun to move at roughly 47 km/hour (about 29 miles per hour: faster than record-breaking sprinter Usain Bolt!), whereas the Earth causes a sedate movement with a speed of only 0.3 km/hour (about 0.2 miles per hour). The size of the wobble is proportional to an orbiting planet\u2019s mass, meaning NEID measurements can be used to determine the masses of exoplanets. Current instruments can measure speeds as low as 3.5 km/hour (just over 2 miles per hour: a slow walking pace), but NEID was built to detect even lower speeds \u2014 potentially uncovering Earth-mass exoplanets.</p>\r\n<p>\u201c<em>In the last decade the state of the art has been roughly 3.5 km/hour,</em>\u201d explains Jason Wright, NEID Project Scientist at Penn State University. \u201c<em>NEID is expected to reach 1 km/hour, pushing the envelope to higher precision.\u201d</em>\u00a0[2]</p>\r\n<p>Already an impressive exoplanet-hunting machine, NEID becomes even more powerful in partnership with space observatories, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.</p>\r\n<p>\u201c<em>When we combine future NEID observations with data from spacecraft, things will really get interesting, and we will be able to learn what planets are made of,</em>\u201d continues Wright. \u201c<em>We will know the planet\u2019s density, which is a clue to understanding how much of an atmosphere the planet has; is it gaseous like Saturn, an ice giant like Neptune, rocky like Earth, or something in between \u2014 a super-Earth or sub-Neptune?</em>\u201d</p>\r\n<p>To allow NEID to make these measurements requires extreme precision \u2014 and an equally extreme instrument. Starlight collected by the WIYN telescope is fed by an optical fiber to a purpose-built thermal enclosure encasing the NEID instrument. To ensure that NEID measurements remain stable over the instrument\u2019s five-year lifetime, its optics are held at a fixed temperature that is stable to within a\u00a0<em>thousandth</em>\u00a0of a degree.</p>\r\n<p>NEID\u2019s first-light observations targeted the star\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi\">51 Pegasi</a>, the first sun-like star found, in 1995, to host an exoplanet.\u00a0<em>\u201cFirst light is an important milestone in an instrument\u2019s development,\u201d</em>\u00a0said Wright.\u00a0<em>\u201cIt is the first verification that NEID is measuring starlight as expected and is on its way to full functionality.\u201d</em></p>\r\n<p>NEID\u2019s capabilities are particularly impressive given how quickly the instrument went from the drawing board to first light. \u201c<em>The short development time of NEID is remarkable,</em>\u201d explains Jayadev Rajagopal of NSF\u2019s OIR Lab, the WIYN telescope scientist and head of operations. \u201c<em>The NEID team has delivered a next-generation instrument in just 3 years and 9 months.</em>\u201d</p>\r\n<p>While NEID is designed to study exoplanets, it must contend with the small-scale motion of the churning plasma at the surfaces of stars which creates signals that can mask or even mimic planetary signals \u2014 a challenge that excites stellar astrophysicists. NEID\u2019s scientific output will be further increased by making the instrument widely available to astronomers, in contrast to other precision radial velocity spectrometers.</p>\r\n<p>\u201c<em>One of the unique aspects of NEID is that it is available for use by all astronomers, in line with the mission of NSF\u2019s OIR Lab,</em>\u201d explains Sarah Logsdon, the NEID Instrument Scientist at NSF\u2019s OIR Lab. With a wider pool of astronomers using NEID to try out a broad range of ideas, the team expects that their spectrograph may prove to be one of the most scientifically productive.</p>\r\n<p>Suvrath Mahadevan, Professor of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at Penn State and Principal Investigator of NEID elaborates: \u201c<em>The NEID project offers the opportunity to work with a talented and dynamic team, to train the next generation of experimentalists, and to develop a discovery machine that all astronomers can apply to use, regardless of nationality, institution or rank.</em>\u201c</p>\r\n<p>Exoplanets discovered with NEID will help identify targets for follow-up observations with upcoming facilities like the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, which will be able to detect and characterize the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. This makes NEID an important part of the ongoing search for other earths, and takes us one step closer to determining if there are truly Earth-like planets elsewhere in the Milky Way.</p>",

    "headline": "Astronomers using the international Gemini Observatory, on Hawaii\u2019s Maunakea, have imaged a very small object in orbit around the Earth, thought to be only a few meters across. According to Grigori Fedorets, the lead astronomer for the observations, the object could be a rare natural rocky object, or it could be something humans put into space decades ago \u2014 essentially space debris. \u201cEither way this is a very compelling object and needs more data to determine what it is,\u201d said Fedorets.",

If it is natural in origin, such as an asteroid, then it is only the second known rocky satellite of the Earth ever discovered in space other than the Moon. The other body, discovered in 2006, has since been ejected out of Earth orbit. 2020 CD3 was discovered on the night of 15 February 2020 by Kacper Wierzchos and Teddy Pruyne at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://catalina.lpl.arizona.edu/\">Catalina Sky Survey</a>\u00a0operating out of the University of Arizona\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/\">Lunar and Planetary Laboratory</a>\u00a0in Tucson, Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>The image, obtained on 24 February 2020, shows simply a tiny pinpoint of light against trailing stars.\u00a0<em>\u201cThe stars are trailing because this object is moving relative to the background stars and the 8-meter Gemini North telescope was tracking on this object,\u201d</em>\u00a0said Fedorets, adding that it is challenging to follow moving objects like this with a big telescope like Gemini. John Blakeslee, Head of Science at the international Gemini Observatory comments,\u00a0<em>\u201cObtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth.
