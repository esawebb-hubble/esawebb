      "headline": "Astronomers using the international Gemini Observatory, on Hawaii\u2019s Maunakea, have imaged a very small object in orbit around the Earth, thought to be only a few meters across. According to Grigori Fedorets, the lead astronomer for the observations, the object could be a rare natural rocky object, or it could be something humans put into space decades ago \u2014 essentially space debris. \u201cEither way this is a very compelling object and needs more data to determine what it is,\u201d said Fedorets.",
      "description": "<p>The newly discovered orbiting object has been assigned the provisional designation 2020 CD3 by the International Astronomical Union\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/\">Minor Planet Center</a>. If it is natural in origin, such as an asteroid, then it is only the second known rocky satellite of the Earth ever discovered in space other than the Moon. The other body, discovered in 2006, has since been ejected out of Earth orbit. 2020 CD3 was discovered on the night of 15 February 2020 by Kacper Wierzchos and Teddy Pruyne at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://catalina.lpl.arizona.edu/\">Catalina Sky Survey</a>\u00a0operating out of the University of Arizona\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.lpl.arizona.edu/\">Lunar and Planetary Laboratory</a>\u00a0in Tucson, Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>The image, obtained on 24 February 2020, shows simply a tiny pinpoint of light against trailing stars.\u00a0<em>\u201cThe stars are trailing because this object is moving relative to the background stars and the 8-meter Gemini North telescope was tracking on this object,\u201d</em>\u00a0said Fedorets, adding that it is challenging to follow moving objects like this with a big telescope like Gemini. John Blakeslee, Head of Science at the international Gemini Observatory comments,\u00a0<em>\u201cObtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth. It is expected to be ejected from Earth\u2019s orbit altogether in April.\u201d</em></p>\r\n<p>Fedorets, an astronomer at<a href=\"https://www.qub.ac.uk/\">\u00a0Queen\u2019s University Belfast</a>, and his team are \u201cpulling out all of the stops\u201d to obtain more data on the object to determine its nature.\u00a0<em>\u201cAdditional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object\u2019s orbit and its possible origin,\u201d</em>\u00a0said Fedorets, adding that its reflectivity is also an important characteristic, as rocky bodies tend to have relatively low reflectivity compared to things like spent rocket boosters.</p>\r\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.gemini.edu/\">international Gemini Observatory</a>\u00a0is a program of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/\">NSF\u2019s</a>\u00a0National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (<a href=\"https://nationalastro.org/\">OIR Lab</a>).

      "headline": "What astronomers thought was a planet beyond our solar system, has now seemingly vanished from sight. Astronomers now suggest that a full-grown planet never existed in the first place. The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope had instead observed an expanding cloud of very fine dust particles caused by a titanic collision between two icy asteroid-sized bodies orbiting the bright star Fomalhaut, about 25 light-years from Earth.",
      "description": "<p>Perched atop Tohono O\u2019odham Nation land in the Arizona-Sonoran Desert, exoplanet-hunting spectrograph NEID [1] is now on the road to discovering Earth-mass exoplanets. The new instrument, an extreme precision radial velocity spectrometer, is collecting starlight on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory (<a href=\"https://nationalastro.org/programs/kitt-peak-national-observatory/\">KPNO</a>), a program of the NSF\u2019s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (<a href=\"https://nationalastro.org/\">NSF\u2019s OIR Lab</a>).</p>\r\n<p>The announcement of first light was made at a press conference held today at the 235th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.</p>\r\n<p>NEID detects exoplanets by measuring the subtle effect these planets have on their parent stars. Planets tug gravitationally on the star they orbit, producing a small \u201cwobble\u201d \u2014 a periodic shift in the velocity of the star. This happens in our own Solar System \u2014 Jupiter causes the Sun to move at roughly 47 km/hour (about 29 miles per hour: faster than record-breaking sprinter Usain Bolt!), whereas the Earth causes a sedate movement with a speed of only 0.3 km/hour (about 0.2 miles per hour). The size of the wobble is proportional to an orbiting planet\u2019s mass, meaning NEID measurements can be used to determine the masses of exoplanets. Current instruments can measure speeds as low as 3.5 km/hour (just over 2 miles per hour: a slow walking pace), but NEID was built to detect even lower speeds \u2014 potentially uncovering Earth-mass exoplanets.</p>\r\n<p>\u201c<em>In the last decade the state of the art has been roughly 3.5 km/hour,</em>\u201d explains Jason Wright, NEID Project Scientist at Penn State University. \u201c<em>NEID is expected to reach 1 km/hour, pushing the envelope to higher precision.\u201d</em>\u00a0[2]</p>\r\n<p>Already an impressive exoplanet-hunting machine, NEID becomes even more powerful in partnership with space observatories, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.</p>\r\n<p>\u201c<em>When we combine future NEID observations with data from spacecraft, things will really get interesting, and we will be able to learn what planets are made of,</em>\u201d continues Wright. \u201c<em>We will know the planet\u2019s density, which is a clue to understanding how much of an atmosphere the planet has; is it gaseous like Saturn, an ice giant like Neptune, rocky like Earth, or something in between \u2014 a super-Earth or sub-Neptune?</em>\u201d</p>\r\n<p>To allow NEID to make these measurements requires extreme precision \u2014 and an equally extreme instrument. Starlight collected by the WIYN telescope is fed by an optical fiber to a purpose-built thermal enclosure encasing the NEID instrument. To ensure that NEID measurements remain stable over the instrument\u2019s five-year lifetime, its optics are held at a fixed temperature that is stable to within a\u00a0<em>thousandth</em>\u00a0of a degree.</p>\r\n<p>NEID\u2019s first-light observations targeted the star\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi\">51 Pegasi</a>, the first sun-like star found, in 1995, to host an exoplanet.\u00a0<em>\u201cFirst light is an important milestone in an instrument\u2019s development,\u201d</em>\u00a0said Wright.\u00a0<em>\u201cIt is the first verification that NEID is measuring starlight as expected and is on its way to full functionality.\u201d</em></p>\r\n<p>NEID\u2019s capabilities are particularly impressive given how quickly the instrument went from the drawing board to first light. \u201c<em>The short development time of NEID is remarkable,</em>\u201d explains Jayadev Rajagopal of NSF\u2019s OIR Lab, the WIYN telescope scientist and head of operations. \u201c<em>The NEID team has delivered a next-generation instrument in just 3 years and 9 months.</em>\u201d</p>\r\n<p>While NEID is designed to study exoplanets, it must contend with the small-scale motion of the churning plasma at the surfaces of stars which creates signals that can mask or even mimic planetary signals \u2014 a challenge that excites stellar astrophysicists. NEID\u2019s scientific output will be further increased by making the instrument widely available to astronomers, in contrast to other precision radial velocity spectrometers.</p>\r\n<p>\u201c<em>One of the unique aspects of NEID is that it is available for use by all astronomers, in line with the mission of NSF\u2019s OIR Lab,</em>\u201d explains Sarah Logsdon, the NEID Instrument Scientist at NSF\u2019s OIR Lab. With a wider pool of astronomers using NEID to try out a broad range of ideas, the team expects that their spectrograph may prove to be one of the most scientifically productive.</p>\r\n<p>Suvrath Mahadevan, Professor of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at Penn State and Principal Investigator of NEID elaborates: \u201c<em>The NEID project offers the opportunity to work with a talented and dynamic team, to train the next generation of experimentalists, and to develop a discovery machine that all astronomers can apply to use, regardless of nationality, institution or rank.</em>\u201c</p>\r\n<p>Exoplanets discovered with NEID will help identify targets for follow-up observations with upcoming facilities like the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, which will be able to detect and characterize the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets. This makes NEID an important part of the ongoing search for other earths, and takes us one step closer to determining if there are truly Earth-like planets elsewhere in the Milky Way.</p>",
