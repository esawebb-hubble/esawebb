    The CDN for resources is set in
    djangoplicity.archives.resources.ResourceManager which doesn't have access
    to the session, so it's not possible to disable the CDN in the Intranet.
    Moreover we actually want to use the CDN from Chile, so we only check if
    the client IP is in the Garching's ranges
    This Middleware is a bit of a hack and replaces URLs pointing to the CDN
    by local URLs
